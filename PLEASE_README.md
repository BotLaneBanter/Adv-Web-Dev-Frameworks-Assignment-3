I wasn't sure how much functionality we needed to exercise regarding the Data Mapper.
So I used the select and insert functions (In loginModel and SignUpModel), as well as genCollection along with a mapper, to grab all user emails
and store them in the SessionManager's protected <b>$access</b> variable, as opposed to hard coding them when signing up a user 
(Done in SessionManager's \_\__construct()_ function).
